# Working with sprites

### Intro

I wanted to make a game in Elm and all the examples I found used gifs to simulate movement. I wanted to use a sprite sheet. There doesn't seem to be robust support for this in elm. These are my attempts to work with a sprite sheet using the Graphics.Element module.

### Issues

Currently the image motion isn't very smooth.
